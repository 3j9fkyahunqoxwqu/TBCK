## Project Overview

Please remember to backup your original prefs.js file before you add the modified user.js file into your profile folder! 

This repository contains a list of about:config settings that I have changed for both
preferential reasons, and also privacy and security reasons.

I do not add comments to each line, this is pointless, you simply can google it yourself or try it yourself and see what happens, takes 2 seconds. Several toggles also getting removed over the time due the nature of software development and improvements. 

### Windows & Linux

The user.js files are  usually identical. The only difference is that the windows version has
Windows friendly carriage returns which you need to change yourself if you like to use the configuration on your Linux OS. 

### General

In Thunderbird, you can get into the `about:config` Window by going to
`Edit -> Preferences`, then select the `Advanced` panel, and then select the
`General` tab. Now click `Config Editor`.

In short, you can either go to the url `about:config` and search for the configs
manually and set them, or you can move the user.js file to the
[profile folder](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder) which differs across
operating systems.
